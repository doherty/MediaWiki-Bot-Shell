=head1 NAME

pwb - a shell interface to your MediaWiki::Bot

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<pwb> [ B<--norc> ] [ B<--verbose> --debug ]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<pwb> (which stands for I<P>erlI<W>ikiI<B>ot) is the default entrance to
L<MediaWiki::Bot::Shell>, which provides a shell interface to your
L<MediaWiki::Bot> (a Perl framework for writing bots to interface with
MediaWiki wikis).

See L<MediaWiki::Bot::Shell>, or run C<help> in the shell, for
information on the available commands.

use MediaWiki::Bot::Shell;
use Getopt::Long;
use Term::Prompt;

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<--verbose>, --debug

Sets the verbosity level. Currently, only on or off, but in the future,
providing this option once will give only error messages, while giving
it twice will provide more detailed non-error output.

=item B<--norc>

Skips reading F<~/.perlwikibot-shell.rc>, and prompts for the same data
instead.

=back

=cut

my %opts = ();
GetOptions(\%opts,
    'verbose|debug+',
    'norc',
);

my $shell = MediaWiki::Bot::Shell->new(\%opts);
$shell->cmdloop();

=head1 FILES

F<~/.perlwikibot-shell.rc> holds login details. The format is simple:

    username = My username          # Your username
    password = totallysecure        # You guessed it!
    host     = meta.wikimedia.org   # Where to log in
    do_sul   = no                   # Whether to do SUL login (takes a bit longer)

By specifying protocol, host, and path, you can use the secure server:

    ...
    protocol = https
    host     = secure.wikimedia.org
    path     = wikipedia/meta/w
    do_sul   = no                   # No need for SUL when using the secure server

If the B<--norc> option is used, or the file doesn't exist or isn't
readable, the user will be prompted for this information.
