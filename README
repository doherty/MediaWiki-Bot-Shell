NAME
    MediaWiki::Bot::Shell - a shell interface to your MediaWiki::Bot

SYNOPSIS
        use MediaWiki::Bot::Shell;

        my $shell = MediaWiki::Bot::Shell->new();
        $shell->cmdloop();

DESCRIPTION
    This provides a shell interface to your MediaWiki::Bot. By initializing
    one or more MediaWiki::Bot objects and using them for the duration of
    your shell session, initialization costs are amortized.

    Configuration data is read from ~/.perlwikibot-shell.rc, or prompted for
    at startup. As an example:

        u@h:~$ cat .perlwikibot-shell.rc
        username    = Mike's bot account
        password    = fibblewibble
        host        = meta.wikimedia.org
        do_sul      = yes

    You should probably just run "pwb", which is included with this module
    to enter your shell.

OPTIONS
    Options are passed to the constructor as a hashref. Options are
    currently:

    debug
        Like it says on the tin. Setting debug provides debug output from
        this module, as well as from the underlying MediaWiki::Bot
        object(s).

    norc
        Don't read options from ~/.perlwikibot-shell.rc. This will result in
        the user being prompted for username, password etc.
